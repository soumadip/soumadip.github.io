Yours taks:
1 Download the file stack/stack_using_array.c in your machine's home directory

2 open terminal and type in the following commands on after another to run the code
	a. cd
	b. gcc stack_using_array.c
	c. ./a.out

3 in the code, the capacity of the storage of the stack is set to 5 by default
	a. do some push, pop, peek, display operations
	b. test the underflow and overflow conditions

4 check the code to understand how it works


Today's Assignments:
