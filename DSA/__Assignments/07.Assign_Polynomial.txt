Today's Assignments:
1 write a code to accept an input polynomial from the user and stores it in a linked list
	a. write appropriate structure for the problem
	b. take user input of the form "Ax^a + Bx^b + Cx^c + ..." (e.g. 10x^3 + 5x^1 + 7) as a string and parse the values
		-- in case, this^ is hard for you (just take the coefficients and the exponents as input ina for loop)
	c. create the following functions 
		- new_node that creates a new node
		- add_node that inserts a node in a correct position so that the polynomial is stored in a sorted mannar
		- find_node that can find a node by it's exponent and returns the address of the node
		- modify_node that takes the address of a node and modifes the coefficient value
		- del_node that can remove a node by it's exponent
		- display_poly that will take a polynomial as input and prints it in the general form i.e. "Ax^a + Bx^b + Cx^c + ..."

2 Write a separate code that can add two polynomials
	- you will use the functions that you have writted above to accomplish this
3 Write a separate code that can multiply two polynomials
	- you will use the functions that you have writted above to accomplish this
