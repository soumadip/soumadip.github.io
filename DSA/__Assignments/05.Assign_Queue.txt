Yours taks:
1 Download the file queue/queue_using_array.c in your machine's home directory

2 open terminal and type in the following commands on after another to run the code
	a. cd
	b. gcc queue_using_array.c
	c. ./a.out

3 the capacity of the queue is set to 5 by default; do some enqueue, dequeue, display operations

4 run the code again and do the following operations in order
	a. make five enqueue operations for 11, 22, 33, 44, 55
	b. display the contents and check the font and rear values
	c. enqueue 66 -> it should overflow
	d. make two dequeue operations
	e. display the contents and check the font and rear values
	f. enqueue 66 -> what does it say?

5 check the code to understand how it works


Today's Assignments:

1 make a copy of the given code and modify the operations so that it becomes a circular queue
2 make your own version of a queue for which the underlying storage is replaced from array to linked list 	
	hint: you can refer to stack.c file in the link which is a linked list based implentation of stack_using_array.c
