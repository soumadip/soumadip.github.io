Yours taks:
1 Download the file linked_list/link.c in your machine's home directory

2 open terminal and type in the following commands on after another to run the code
	a. cd
	b. gcc link.c
	c. ./a.out

3 in the code, the capacity of the storage of the stack is set to 5 by default
	a. do some add, del, display, etc. 
	b. test different boundary cases

4 check the code to understand how it works


Today's Assignments:

1 add following four functions to this code consistant with the coding style
	a. search_all that searches a given value in the linked list and prints all positions where the value is present
	b. add_by_pos that can add a value at a given position
	c. del_by_pos that can delete a value at a given position
	d. print_reversed that will print the linked list values in reverse order and it does not change the actual list
2 add appropriate entries to the while loop in the main function so that all the above functions can be called
