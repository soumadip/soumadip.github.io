1. For each of the questions you need to write a c file, name the file in the following format
	if the last two digits of your rollnumber is 99, then for question number A1.1 the solution file should have a name A1.1_99.c
2. You may choose to pair up (in a group of two persons max) for solving the assignments
	if the last two digits of your rollnumbers are 99 and 98 respectively, then for question number A1.1 the solution file should have a name A1.1_99_98.c
3. Once you are done writing the code, you must run you code and check with different inputs whenever necessary 
	you need to make sure that your code must run i.e. compile successfully and execute
4. Keep all c files for an assignment in a single folder
	you can zip the folder by right click on the folder and select compress

submission recommendations
The evaluation of the assignments will be done online.
Your submitted code should run/execute
You can submit partial codes (in case you are unable make the code run successfully), but make sure you understand the portions you have submitted.

Evaluation Process:
I pick some random submissions for each student (even if you are working in groups) and ask them to explain how that code is working.
Additionally, I may make some small changes in your code and ask you to explain the effects of the changes.
Therefore, you must understand what exactly you are submitting - so only submit the codes, that you understand properly.
