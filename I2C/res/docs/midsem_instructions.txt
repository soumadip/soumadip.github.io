Instructions (please read carefully each point)
Write as little as possible without missing out on any details
Think carefully before answering
There is no marks on being verbose
Sometimes, adding an example makes things easier
The higher the marks are, the more you need to check your answers
You can answer any combination of questions as long as the total marks attempted is less than or equal to 25,  i.e., any question attempted beyond 25 marks will not be considered while marking
If you are making any valid assumption(s) while writing an answer, do remember to mention that information clearly and concisely
For 1 Mark questions, no explanations are required; just write the answers.
For 2 mark questions, you can just write the coding logic (2-4 lines), no need to write full code
For 4 mark questions, write full codes, minor mistakes (missing a semicolon, forget to close a bracket, etc.) are ok, major mistakes (messing up syntax for a loop, switch case, incorrect function prototype, etc.) are not.
2 bonus marks will be awarded if there is no minor mistakes as well as major ones
Consider all questions are for C language and assume the size of int and float as 4 bytes, char as 1 byte, double as 8 bytes in this exam; also note the characters are evaluated using their ASCII values A-Z are valued 65-90 and a-z are valued 97-122 respectively
