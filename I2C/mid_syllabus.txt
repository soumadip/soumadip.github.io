Hints:
<<If you have a good understanding (not memorization) of the underlying concepts, you should be able get full marks>>
Practice coding using pencil and paper
Verify your coding accuracy by executing the code on machine
	-- when you can predict the output of your code before running, you know you have learnt that concept
Question type to expect in exam:
	-- understanding of the basics, mostly questions that you do not need to mug up
	-- evaluate given expressions (arithmatic, logical, assignment, or any compbination of the same)
	-- form logical expresions for a problem
	-- application of brancing and looping (including nested)
