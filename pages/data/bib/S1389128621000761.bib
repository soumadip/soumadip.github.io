abstract = {Minimizing the number of handovers incurred by a mobile User Equipment (UE) in a LTE network is an important and well-studied problem. In a dense LTE network, a mobile UE may have many target base stations (eNBs) for handover at any point in time, and choosing the correct target eNB that reduces the number of spurious handovers while maintaining good signal quality is a challenging problem. An additional problem is to avoid unbalanced distribution of UEs among candidate eNBs with similar capabilities to ensure better network resource utilization and user experience. In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing the number of handovers incurred by mobile UEs in a dense LTE network while balancing the load among the eNBs. In particular, we formulate two problems - Handover Minimized User Association for Single UE (HMUA-S) that addresses the problem of minimizing the number of handovers for a single UE, and Load Balanced Handover Minimized User Association (HMUA-LB) that addresses the problem of jointly maximizing the number of eNBs that are not highly loaded and minimizing the number of handovers per UE in a scenario with multiple UEs. We first propose an algorithm, UE Association based on Look-ahead Signal Strength Approximation (USSL-A), for the HMUS-S problem. A greedy heuristic algorithm called LB-USSL is then proposed for the HMUA-LB problem. Detailed simulation results are given on real world scenarios to show that the algorithms significantly outperform other existing algorithms that address similar problems.}
