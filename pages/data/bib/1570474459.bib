ABSTRACT="Handover, the process of transferring a call or data session from one base
station to another without disconnection, is an important problem in LTE
networks. Several handover algorithms have been proposed for LTE networks
in general. However, they mostly use the current signal strengths for
making handover decisions, which can cause spurious handovers in a dense
eNB deployment. In this paper, we investigate the use of look-ahead signal
strength information for reducing spurious handovers. We first propose a
novel graph-based framework that uses signal strength information along the
mobile trajectory of the UE to make better handover decisions. Two
algorithms are then presented based on this framework. The first algorithm
assumes that exact signal measurements at the UE from all eNBs in its
trajectory are available a priori for all time instances, and provides a
baseline reference for finding the minimum number of handovers that can be
achieved. The second algorithm uses the exact signal measurement for the
current time instance only, and estimates the signal strengths for future
time instances. The performance of the algorithms are compared with four
existing LTE handover algorithms using simulation on real world data. It is
shown that the proposed algorithms significantly reduce the number of
handovers while still maintaining good signal quality for communication
throughout the trajectory of the UE."
