ABSTRACT="Most existing UE association techniques consider signal strength from eNBs
as the primary metric for handover decisions. This may result in unbalanced
distribution of UEs to eNBs in a dense LTE network with large number of
users, even though a UE may have multiple good eNB options for association.
In this paper we propose a load balancing framework that can be applied
over any existing handover algorithm periodically to balance eNB loads. The
framework uses a novel metric based on eNB-availability-option of UEs for
choosing the set of UEs to handover to balance load and their target eNBs,
while ensuring good signal quality. A specific algorithm based on the
framework is proposed and evaluated by simulating on NS-3 over five
existing handover algorithms."
