<h4>Bio</h4>

<div  class="bio column">
<p title="">
    I am a typical fun loving Bengali guy who loves to surprise his mouth (I mean eating new dishes). I also like good music, road trip on two-wheelers, photography and sleeping. I love theoretical mathematics (does not necessarily mean I know a lot) and puzzles. 
</p>
<p title="New Place, Higher Education">
    I was born and brought up in Berhampore, a small and beautiful town in the middle of West Bengal, India. I grew up there until my high school studies were complete. Then, I moved to Kolkata, India to enter the field of Computer Science and Engineering, and was awarded my Bachelor degree there. Subsequently, I moved to Kharagpur to pursue my Master degree from one of the premier institutes in India. 
</p>
<p title="During Job">
    Afterwards, I took a job as Software Developer with Citrix, for which I shifted to Bangalore, India. During this stay, I worked, travelled, met new people, made new friends and had a lot of fun. I spent there about two years, only to realise that I wanted to be back in academics. 
</p>
<p title="Back to Academics">
    So, I came back to IIT Kharagpur chasing the dream and currently pursuing my PhD degree under the joint supervision of Prof. Arobinda Gupta and Prof. Sandip Chakraborty. I am at present researching in the domain of <b>LTE</b> (Long Term Evolution) Technology of Mobile Communication.
