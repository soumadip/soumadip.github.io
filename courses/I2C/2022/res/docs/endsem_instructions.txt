Instructions (please read carefully each point)
Write as little as possible without missing out on any details
	Think carefully before answering
	There is no marks on being verbose
	Sometimes, adding an example makes things easier

There are two sections in the paper - (A) the mandatory section and (B) the optional section

You can answer any combination of questions from the mandatory Section A as long as the total marks attempted is less than or equal to 50,  i.e., any question attempted beyond 50 marks will not be considered while marking

Additionally, you can attempt the optional Section B which contains 10 marks in total; this may be considered at the time of final grading but not for the End-sem exam itself

If you are making any valid assumption(s) while writing an answer, do remember to mention that information clearly and concisely

3 bonus marks will be awarded if there is no minor mistakes as well as major ones, and questions worth a total of 50 marks are attempted

Consider all questions in the section A are for C language and assume the size of int and float as 4 bytes, char as 1 byte, double as 8 bytes, pointer types as 8 bytes for this exam; also note the characters are evaluated using their ASCII values A-Z are valued 65-90 and a-z are valued 97-122 respectively

Questions marked with [Python] are all-or-nothing questions. For the rest, there will be part-marking.
