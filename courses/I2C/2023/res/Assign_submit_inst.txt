Evaluation Process:
I pick some random submissions for each student and ask them to explain how that code is working.
Additionally, I may make some small changes in your code and ask you to explain the effects of the changes.
Therefore, you must understand what exactly you are submitting - so only submit the codes, that you understand properly.
