For compiling c programs use

	$gcc <filename> -lpthread
	outputs of all programs are attached.

here are some instructions.

Threre are Three folders

>>"prb1_using mySemaphore"

	this is implementation of my own semaphore variables 

	i have done 1a, 1b and 1d in this implementation
	for id as there is no infinite loop is there so if you give input #consumer > #producer, some consumer(s) may 		wait indefinitely at the end of all producers, in case of infinite loop(just replace while loop condition by 1), 	this 	works Fine.
	
	in case of 1c, removing busy wait i had used Signaling inlinux, but that leads to some proble while implementing
	thus it is not working properly.
	

>>"prb1_using system semaphore" 

	this implementation is using system semaphore variables
	for implementing 1ab problem 
	I have used pthread_mutex variable from pthread library]
	
		for 1c problem i have used sembuff structure form <sys/sem.h>
	here i have removed the busy wait in case of checking the #item present in the buffer
	
	for 1d problem
	it is an infinite loop
	just give any #consumers and #producers, and it will work.


>>"Prb2_JAVA"

	this is two implementations of 2nd problem.
	basically they are same apart from the 'synchronized' keyword.This is also an infinite loopp, see the output.
