1. Draw diagrams whenever possible to show nodes, messages, state transitions, etc.
2. Focus on understanding (not mugging up) the algorithms that are in the syllabus
3. I will not ask you to write the algorithms as they are - I will ask you to write some modifications over them
4. Make sure you understand how to write the algorithms in the proper format - check books, slides
5. There will be some numericals 
     - mostly questions will ask you to show how a particular execution of any of those algorithm will work 
     - you will need to show what value changes at what point in time, for this you need to understand those algorithms thoroughly
6. There will be remember type questions which will be of 2 marks, for the rest you need to analyze the problem and solutions
7. It is important to remember that there can be mutiple correct answer to a single question, since these are design type questions 
     - so, it is important to justify your answers properly
8. There will be questions that will ask you to analyze complexities of existing/modified algorithms
     - you can't just write the answers
     - you need to show how the complexity value is computed
9. most importantly, try to write exact answers, there is no marks for being verbose - remember the 3Cs of answering question
     - Clear, Concise and Correct
